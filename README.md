# WiDS Datathon 2022

This repository contains my source code as it relates to my solution for the 2022 Women in Data Science ("WiDS") kaggle competition.  My final solution ended up in the top 10% of all solutions.

For a better viewing experience, I would recommend viewing my notebooks on Kaggle rather than here on GitHub.  You can find the notebooks at the below links:

- Machine learning notebook
- Exploratory data analysis notebook (link to be included soon, currently cleaning this notebook up)
